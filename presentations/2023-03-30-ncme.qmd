# Research Problem

+ IRT models specified as linear mixed models are not new (e.g., Adams, Wilson, & Wu, 1997; Kamata, 2001; Mellenbergh, 1994; Rijmen et al., 2003).
+ Some have discussed evaluating DIF in these frameworks too (e.g., Noorgate and De Boeck, 2005).
+ To our knowledge, these methods have not been explored to which the extent they properly link scores.




# Heterotypic Continuity

+ We approach this research primarily from a psychological measurement lens, where heterotypic continuity is often of concern.
+ **Heterotypic Continuity** occurs when the same psychological reasons underlie different behaviors at different agesâ€”the same construct *looks different* across development (Petersen, Choe & LeBeau, 2020). 
+ Examples: Externalizing Problems (Petersen & LeBeau, 2020; Petersen & LeBeau, 2021)




# Limitations of current linking

+ Item parameter estimates treated as known parameters for linking.
    + Problematic in small samples
+ Does not account for any clustering in the data collection design
+ Current software for linking is cumbersome to use.
    + Limits use for applied researchers




# Bayesian Generalized Linear Mixed Model

Focusing on dichotomous items, we could define a 2pl IRT model within a linear mixed model:

$$
P(y = 1) = logistic(\alpha_{i}(b_{p} + \gamma_{i}))
$$

+ $\alpha_{i}$ is item specific discrimination  
+ $b_{p}$ is a random person effect, often called theta or ability  
+ $\gamma_{i}$ is an item easiness term  




## Adding Attributes

Attributes can be added as item, person, or both item and person attributes. 

Example: 

$$
P(y = 1) = logistic(\alpha_{i}(b_{p} + \gamma_{i} + X_{jpi} \beta_{j}))
$$

+ $X_{jpi}$ is a design matrix. 
+ $\beta_{j}$ are a set of $J$ regression coefficients. 




## Specific Example - 3 time points

Example

$$
P(y = 1) = logistic(\alpha_{i}(b_{p} + \gamma_{i} + \beta_{1} time_{2} + \beta_{2} time_{3}))
$$

+ $time_{2}$ is a dummy attribute, 1 = time 2, 0 = otherwise  
+ $time_{3}$ is a dummy attribute, 1 = time 3, 0 = otherwise  




# Simulation Conditions

+ Sample size fixed at 1000
+ 3 time points
+ Number of items fixed at 20 for each time point
+ 10 common items (40 total items, 10 in common, 10 unique across 3 time points)
+ Change in common easiness: -0.5, 0, 0.5




# Data Generation

+ Data were generated by randomly generating 1000 person parameters (ability/theta)
+ Item parameter were randomly generated for all unique items (30 items)
+ Common item parameters at each time point were shifted based on the change in common easiness.

# Concluding Remarks

+ Fitting IRT models as mixed models is highly flexible.
+ Preliminary evidence suggests adequate recovery of parameters.
+ May work in small samples due to ability to impose prior information




# Future Work

+ Vary more data conditions to evaluate ability to link across different situations
    + Non-linear change across time
    + More time points
    + Smaller sample size
+ Evaluate more complex model to allow variance of person parameters to change over time
