# Overview
1. (G)LMMs
2. Power
3. `simglm` package
4. Demo Shiny App!



# Linear Mixed Model (LMM)

# Power
- Power is the ability to statistically detect a true effect (i.e. non-zero population effect).
- For simple models (e.g. t-tests, regression) there are closed form equations for generating power.
    + R has routines for these: `power.t.test, power.anova.test`
    + Gpower3


    
# Power Example

```r
n <- seq(4, 1000, 2)
power <- sapply(seq_along(n), function(i) 
  power.t.test(n = n[i], delta = .15, sd = 1, type = 'two.sample')$power)
```

# Power for (G)LMM
- Power for more complex models is not as straightforward; 
    + particularly with messy real world data.
- There is software for the GLMM models to generate power:
    + Optimal Design: <http://hlmsoft.net/od/>
    + MLPowSim: <http://www.bristol.ac.uk/cmm/software/mlpowsim/>
    + Snijders, *Power and Sample Size in Multilevel Linear Models*.



# Power is hard
- In practice, power is hard.
- Need to make many assumptions on data that has not been collected.
    + Therefore, data assumptions made for power computations will likely differ from collected sample.
- A power analysis needs to be flexible, exploratory, and well thought out.



# `simglm` Overview
- `simglm` aims to simulate (G)LMMs with up to three levels of nesting (aim to add more later).
- Flexible data generation allows: 
    + any number of covariates and discrete covariates 
    + change random distribution 
    + unbalanced data 
    + missing data 
    + serial correlation.
- Also has routines to generate power.



# Demo Shiny App

```r
shiny::runGitHub('simglm', username = 'lebebr01', subdir = 'inst/shiny_examples/demo')
```
or 

```r
devtools::install_github('lebebr01/simglm')
library(simglm)
run_shiny()
```

- Must have following packages installed: `simglm, shiny, shinydashboard, ggplot2, lme4, DT`.
