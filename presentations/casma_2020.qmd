# Methodological Problem
- Heterotypic Continuity
    + Behavioral manifestations change with development.

- The following aspects across time change:
    1. Rank order across people
    2. Level on the construct
    3. Strength of construct.




# Common Approaches in Psychology
1. Using only common items across time
2. Use all item over time
3. Factor Analytic/IRT approaches with linking
4. SEM

# Externalizing Problems
1. We examined whether within-child changes in language ability predict concomitant within-child changes in externalizing problems 
2. We examined whether social skills are a potential mechanism that explains the association between language ability and externalizing problems 



# Externalizing Measures
- CBCL 4 - 18: Mothers from 4 to 10 years of age.
- TRF: Teachers from age 4 to 10, age 4 was a preschool or other caregiver.
- We created developmental scales using IRT and linking for each rater independently.
- Separate mixed models fitted for each rater.
- Explored cross-lagged panel models as well.

# A Simulation



# Approaches
1. All possible content: Summed scores
2. Only common content: Summed scores
3. Construct valid content: IRT developmentally scaled factor scores
4. Construct valid contnet: IRT factor scores (not developmentally scaled)
5. All possible content: IRT developmentally scaled factor scores
6. All possible content: IRT factor scores (not developmentally scaled)



# Balanced Design
- Number of Items: 20 or 40 items
- Proportion of common content: .2, .5, .8
- Change in severity (difficulty) common content: -0.5, -0.25, -0.1, 0, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5
- Average severity (difficulty) unique content: -2, -1, 0, 1, 2



# Unbalanced Design
- Varied:
    + Change in severity (difficulty) common content: -0.5, 0.5
    + Average severity (difficulty) unique content: -2, 0, 2
- Fixed:
    + Number of Items: 15 time 1; 25 time 2; 40 time 3
    + Common items fixed at 10



# Simulation process
1. Randomly generate item parameters for common items
    + Discrim: log normal, mean 0, sd 0.25
    + Severity: Normal, mean 0, sd 1
2. Linked item parameters across time based on change in severity of common content.
3. Randomly generate item parameters for unique items
4. Randomly generate latent externalizing problems scores (i.e. factor scores), normal: mean 0, sd 1
5. Simulate item responses using item parameters and factor scores.



# Simulation Process 2
- For all item content:
    + Transformed unique non-construct valid content, add 5 SD to severity, cut discrimination in half.



# Outcomes
1. Standardized slope estimates
2. Bias in factor scores at time 1
3. Mean absolute error of factor scores at time 1
