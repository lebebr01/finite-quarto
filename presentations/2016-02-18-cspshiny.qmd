# Overview
<img src=" /images/flowchart.png" alt=""/>



# R
- R is an open source statistical programming language.
    - Pros:
        + Common statistical procedures are found in R
        + Can extend functionality with packages/functions
    - Cons:
        + Need to be comfortable with code

# Reproducible Research
- Reproducible research has become popular.
    - Commonly a document that contains both analysis and text.
    - This can be done with `Rmarkdown` and `knitr.`

# Iterative/Interactive Data Analysis
- This type of analysis requires some input from the user.
    + Data analysts may use `R`
    + `Shiny` is a great option for code novices

# Iterative Task Examples
- Building Assessments
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Exploring Missing Data Patterns
- Model Selection/Building

# What is Shiny?
- `Shiny` is an interactive web application framework for R.
    + Example: <http://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/movie-explorer.html>

# Components of Shiny
1. User Interface (ui.r)
    - What the user sees and interacts with
2. R Analysis (server.r)
    - The R code running behind the scenes



# User Interface
- Simple user interface example from RStudio
    - <http://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/telephones-by-region.html>

```r
shinyUI(
  
  fluidPage(    
    
    titlePanel("Telephones by region"),
    
    sidebarLayout(      
      
      sidebarPanel(
        selectInput("region", "Region:", 
                    choices = colnames(WorldPhones)),
        hr(),
        helpText("Data from AT&T (1961) The World's Telephones.")
      ),
      
      mainPanel(
        plotOutput("phonePlot")  
      )
      
    )
  )
)
```



# Server File
- The server file for RStudio example 
    - <http://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/telephones-by-region.html>
    
```r
shinyServer(function(input, output) {
  
  output$phonePlot <- renderPlot({
    
    barplot(WorldPhones[ , input$region] * 1000, 
            main = input$region,
            ylab = "Number of Telephones",
            xlab = "Year")
  })
})
```



# Interactivity is Key
<img src="/images/interactivity.png" alt=""/>



# Tools for Interactivity 
- Interactive Graphics
    + Using JavaScript - D3 graphics (`rCharts`)
    + Interactive static graphics - Garrett's presentation
- Interactive Tables
    + Using DT R package


    
# Reporting from Shiny
- Using `Rmarkdown` and `knitr` to create customizable reproducible reports
    - Example: generate report button
- Generate final data files
    - Example: download data button



# Strengths of Using Shiny
1. The app can be written solely using R code
    - Can use CSS, JavaScript, or HTML as needed
2. User does not need to know any R
3. Many hosting options
4. Application can be as simple or complex as needed (both visually and functionally)
5. Flexible output



# Weaknesses of Using Shiny
1. May take more time to develop initially
2. Need some R familiarity for development



# Background for Demo
- In educational assessment, we need to create new test forms
    - Exposure concerns
    - Add new content
    - Altering test landscape
- Building test forms is an iterative process that involves gathering information from:
    - Item analyses
    - Test blueprints
    - Item response theory (IRT)



# IRT Data
```
##      Item.1 Item.2 Item.3 Item.4 Item.5 Item.6 Item.7 Item.8
## [1,]      1      1      1      1      1      1      1      1
## [2,]      0      1      0      0      1      0      1      0
## [3,]      1      1      1      0      1      0      1      0
## [4,]      0      1      0      1      1      0      1      0
## [5,]      0      1      1      1      1      0      1      1
## [6,]      1      1      0      0      1      0      1      0
```

# Demo
<https://github.com/lebebr01/BuildForm>

```r
# Basic Theme
shiny::runGitHub('lebebr01/BuildForm', subdir = 'R', ref = 'basic')

# shinydashboard
shiny::runGitHub('lebebr01/BuildForm', subdir = 'R', ref = 'testmodule')
```



# Benefits of Shiny for Iterative Data Analysis
1. Free valuable data analyst/scientist resources.
2. Improve data literacy in the organization.
3. Highly customizable
    - Analysis (server.r)
    - User interface (ui.r)
    - Reporting



# Weaknesses of Shiny for Iterative Data Analysis
1. Need to train users
    - Analysis
    - Navigating web application
2. Knowledge of JavaScript, CSS, or HTML useful.



# Guidelines for Building Shiny Apps
1. Understand reactive coding.
2. Modularize your code - define functions for repetitive code chunks.
3. Define scope early.
    - Define output.
4. Clean up UI last.
